üçé FreshTrack: Predictive Food Waste & Donation Assistant
FreshTrack is a smart, AI-powered platform designed to help retailers combat food waste by predicting spoilage and facilitating timely intervention. By leveraging machine learning and real-time data, the system recommends optimal actions like discounting, stock rotation, or donation, turning potential waste into social and business value. The project was developed as part of the Walmart Sparkathon 2025.

üéØ Problem Statement
Retailers globally face significant financial losses and environmental burden due to avoidable food waste. Much of this food is still edible, but is discarded because there's a lack of a streamlined system for timely intervention or donation. FreshTrack bridges this gap by providing predictive insights and automated processes to minimize waste and fight hunger.

üí° Core Solution
An intelligent, role-based platform that tracks inventory shelf life in real time. FreshTrack uses machine learning to forecast spoilage and provides actionable recommendations to minimize waste, boost community aid, and generate ESG insights for stakeholders.
